**Important**: If you installed Manim in the recommended way, using the Python management tool **uv**, then you either need to make sure the corresponding virtual environment is activated (follow the instructions printed on running ```uv venv```), or you need to remember to prefix the ```manim``` command in the console with ```uv run```; that is, ```uv run manim ...```.
