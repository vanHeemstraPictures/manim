# 200 - Overview
This quickstart guide will lead you through creating a sample project using Manim: an animation engine for precise programmatic animations.

First, you will use a command line interface to create a ```Scene```, the class through which Manim generates videos. In the ```Scene``` you will animate a circle. Then you will add another ```Scene``` showing a square transforming into a circle. This will be your introduction to Manim’s animation ability. 

Afterwards, you will position multiple mathematical objects (```Mobject```s). Finally, you will learn the ```.animate``` syntax, a powerful feature that animates the methods you use to modify ```Mobject```s.
